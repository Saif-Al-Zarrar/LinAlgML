## Cheatsheet

## Setup Development Environment

1) Install Git
https://git-scm.com/downloads

2) Go into terminal and make dir (assuming current dir home), cd into it
```console
mkdir JupyterProjects
cd JupyterProjects
mkdir LinAlgML
cd LinAlgML
```
3) Pull repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/csalinasonline/LinAlgML.git
```
4) Download Anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/

5) Create a Conda env
```console
conda create -n "blah..." python=3.6
```
6) Activate env
```console
conda activate "blah..."
```
7) Pip install requirements
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt

8) Go into Notebooks
```console
cd Notebooks
```
9) Try it out!
